Even though i already have a little bit of programming knowledge (through various random bits and pieces i picked up along the way). I always think it's nice to build a nice strong foundation before attempting bigger things.

Following that mentality i decided i would revisit the legendary book "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition of course).

This is a test!!

And to aid that process i have made this little subsite:
